This mod will show total value of the valuables on the map and update in real-time as things break or are spawned in or extracted. Current position is the right hand side of the screen a little below the extraction goal.

Is ALWAYS ON by default. Set 'AlwaysOn' and 'UseValueRatio' to false to pull up map value by pressing the Map button (Tab by default).

Configuration variables:
- AlwaysOn set to true will keep the value always on the HUD. Overrides any other setting like UseValueRatio.
- UseValueRatio set to true will only show the map value when your remaining map value is some ratio, 'ValueRatio', of the current extraction goal. Needs 'AlwaysOn' set to false to be usable.
- ValueRatio is the ratio of Map value to extraction goal. Ex: Configure 'AlwaysOn' to false, 'UseValueRatio' to true, and 'ValueRatio' to 2.0 to have it appear when remaining map value is 2x the current extraction goal.
